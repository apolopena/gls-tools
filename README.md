## Bash scripted command line tools for updating, installing, uninstalling and testing [`gitpod-laravel-starter`](https://github.com/apolopena/gitpod-laravel-starter)

NONE OF THESE TOOLS ARE READY FOR PRODUCION USE. THIS LINE WILL BE REMOVED PRIOR TO THE FIRST STABLE RELEASE.

#### Note: _Bash 4.0 or higher is required. If you run these scripts outside of Gitpod and you are using a mac you will need to [update your version of bash](https://clubmate.fi/upgrade-to-bash-4-in-mac-os-x)_

## âš¡ Install `gls`
You can install `gls` to `/usr/local/bin` which is a tool that runs all the non internal `gls-tools` scripts locally on the filesystem and is complete with `--help`, `--version` and command information. 
`gls` must be installed as root since it installs to your `/usr/local/bin`. This is safe as any installer and perhaps more safe than binary installers since all the code in this repository encapsualtes it's code into functions and is transparent open source. Please feel free to inspect all the code in this repository. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apolopena/gls-tools/main/setup/install-gls.sh | sudo bash
```
## Using `gls-tools` individually
Most of the operations these scripts perform are one time tasks they are best done remotely using `curl` `wget` or `fetch` however these tool scripts can also be put into your `/usr/loca/bin` if you find yourself using them often.

If you would like to use `wget` or `fetch` to execute `gls-tools` tool scripts you can but the implemenation for that is for that is left up to you. `curl` commands are provided in the section for each script.

```bash
 bash <( curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apolopena/gls-tools/main/tools/install.sh ) 
 ```

 > Force install the latest version of [`gitpod-laravel-starter`](https://github.com/apolopena/gitpod-laravel-starter). This is a good option when you want to install [`gitpod-laravel-starter`](https://github.com/apolopena/gitpod-laravel-starter) into an empty project.
